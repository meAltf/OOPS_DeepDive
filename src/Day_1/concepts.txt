âœ… Day 1: Introduction to OOP, Classes & Objects, Encapsulation

* Object-Oriented-Programming :
- It is a programming paradigm that organizes code using objects.
- It represents real-world entities with properties(data) and behaviour(methods).
- Encapsulation | Inheritance | Abstraction | Polymorphism

* Classes & Objects :
- Class |  A blueprint or template to create objects.
- Object | An instance of class

* Encapsulation | Data Hiding :
- It bundles data & method together, that operate on data within a class.
- It restrict direct access of the data outside the class using access modifiers.

* Benefits :
- Protects object integrity | Hide complexity | Increase code maintainability

* Real world use cases :
- ATM system : Balance is encapsulated, users can only withdraw or deposit via public methods.


* Interview Q&A -
* How encapsulation implemented in Java ?
- Using private access modifier for variable(data)
- And public getter/setter to access or modify them
- It protects the internal state & hides implementation details

* Summary :
- Class defined the structure but Object is the real entity.
- Encapsulation hides the data using private fields and public methods.
