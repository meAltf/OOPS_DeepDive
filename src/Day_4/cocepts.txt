üóìÔ∏è Day 4: Abstraction, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces

* Abstraction :
- It is a process of hiding the internal implementation details and showing only essentials features to the user.
- Focuses on: What an object does, not how does it

* Abstract class :
- It can have abstract methods (no body) and concrete(simple) methods.
- Cannot be instantiated directly.
- Subclass must override abstract methods.
- Constructor allowed.

* Interface :
- Interface like, A pure Abstraction. All methods are abstract by default (until java7).
- Interface define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
- Implicitly All methods are public & abstract.
- Constructor not allowed.

* Interface default & Static methods (Java 8+)
- default methods can have body, and also it can be overridden.
- Static methods belongs to interface, it can't be belongs to instances.

* Interview Q&A :
1. Can an interface have fields ?
- Yes, but only "public static final" constants.


NOTE :
- A class can extend abstract class and implement an interface.
