üóìÔ∏è Day 2: Inheritance, Method Overriding, and super Keyword

* Inheritance :
- It is a mechanism where a new class(child/subclass) inherits properties and behaviour(fields & methods) from an existing class(parent/superclass).

* Why use it:
- Reuse common code | Establish IS-A relationship [ If Dog extends Animal, Dog IS-A Animal. ]

* Types of Inheritance in Java :
- Single        | A-> B
- Multiple      | A->B->C
- Hierarchical  | A->B, A->C
- MultiLevel    | A,B -> C | ‚ùå Not with classes (‚úÖ With interfaces)

* Method Overriding :
- When a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its super class.

* Key rules for method overriding :
- Method name and parameters must match.
- Use @Override annotation to avoid mistake. | MUST

* Super keyword :
- Access super class methods or constructors from subclass.

* Interview Q&A :

* Can constructors be inherited ?
- No, Constructors are not inherited.
- But, superclass constructors can be called using super().

NOTE :
1. Private members are not inherited, Use protected if subclass access needed.
