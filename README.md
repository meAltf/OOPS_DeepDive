# 🚀 Java OOP Deep Dive: Mastering SOLID Principles & Design Patterns

This repository is a complete **5-day self-paced journey** into mastering **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java from scratch — with a strong emphasis on **SOLID principles**, **real-world design patterns**, and **interview-ready coding skills**.

## 📅 Day-wise Breakdown

| Day        | Focus Areas                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Day 1** | Classes, Objects, Abstraction vs Encapsulation           |
| ✅ **Day 2** | Inheritance, `super` keyword, Method Overriding         |
| ✅ **Day 3** | Polymorphism (Compile-time & Runtime)                   |
| ✅ **Day 4** | SOLID Principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)              |
| ✅ **Day 5** | Real-World Design Patterns aligned with SOLID           |
